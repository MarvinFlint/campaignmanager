# What is this

This is supposed to become an app to create and manage DND campaigns. This is mostly for myself.

# How to start

Create a Postgres DB based on the db.sql in /backend

In /backend, run

```
npm run dev
```

to start the backend express server. 

In /Module Manager, run

```
npm run dev
```

to start the vue dev server. Visit the URL in your console to see the frontend.

# TODO

Basically everything. Haven't even decided on the frameworks I will use or what backend.
